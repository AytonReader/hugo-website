# Zibaldone

> According to Wikipedia: A zibaldone is an Italian vernacular commonplace book. The word means "a heap of things" or "miscellany" in Italian.

This post marks the beginning of my zibaldone/portfolio website. I will be using this site as a place to post about my working experiences, interesting projects I'm working on, my hobbies, and any other things I find interesting that I want to share.
