## Context
From June, I spent three months working with Omron Australia as an engineering intern. I used my short time with Omron as an opportunity to build my professional network, and further put my name out as a professional contractor. I was fortunate enough to spend the first two months in-office, and got to know some of the Omron Melbourne staff on a deeper level. As well as completing PLC training, I worked on two larger projects:
  1. Building a PLC library to handle fuzzy logic.
  2. [Improving the UI for a bootstrapping software.](/posts/003-omron-vbnet)
